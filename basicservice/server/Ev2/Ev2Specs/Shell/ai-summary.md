## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/Ev2/Ev2Specs/Shell/push-image-to-acr.sh
This Bash script is designed to push a Docker image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR). It checks for necessary environment variables such as DESTINATION_ACR_NAME, TARBALL_IMAGE_FILE_SAS, IMAGE_NAME, TAG_NAME, and DESTINATION_FILE_NAME. The script logs into Azure using a managed identity, downloads a Docker tarball image, retrieves ACR credentials, and then pushes the image to the specified ACR.
