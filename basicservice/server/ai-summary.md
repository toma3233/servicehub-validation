**Tags:** Dockerfile, Go, build, deployment, Makefile, Kubernetes

## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/Dockerfile_workspace
This Dockerfile is used to build and deploy a Go-based service. It consists of two stages: a build stage and a deployment stage. In the build stage, it sets up a Go environment, configures git, and compiles several Go binaries from a repository hosted on Azure DevOps. The deployment stage uses an OpenJDK image to run the compiled server binary.

### /basicservice/server/Dockerfile
This Dockerfile is designed to build a Go-based server application in two stages. The first stage builds the Go binaries for client, demoserver, and server from a specified Azure DevOps repository. The second stage uses an OpenJDK base image to prepare the final Docker image, copying the built binaries from the first stage. It includes configuration for private Go modules and uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication with Azure DevOps.

### /basicservice/server/Makefile
This Makefile is used for building, testing, deploying, and managing a service called 'basicservice' within a larger project. It includes targets for templating files, deploying resources, tidying dependencies, running tests, building binaries, and managing Docker images. The file also includes commands for installing, upgrading, and uninstalling the service using Helm on a Kubernetes cluster.
