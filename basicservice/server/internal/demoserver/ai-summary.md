## Directory Summary
This directory contains Go files for implementing and testing a demo server using the gRPC framework. It includes the SayHello method, server setup, and options configuration, along with a test suite using the Ginkgo testing framework. Some files are auto-generated, providing foundational server and logging capabilities.

**Tags:** Go, gRPC, demoserver, server, testing

## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/SayHello.go
This Go file defines a method `SayHello` in the `demoserver` package. The method takes a context and a `HelloRequest` object as input and returns a `HelloReply` object or an error. It logs the request, simulates a delay, and returns a response message containing the name, age, and email from the request. If the name is 'TestPanic', it triggers a panic.

### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/api.go
This Go file defines a server implementation for a demo service using the gRPC framework. It imports a protocol buffer package and extends the `UnimplementedBasicServiceServer` struct from the gRPC-generated code. The file includes a `Server` struct, a constructor `NewServer` that returns a pointer to a new `Server` instance, and an `init` function that takes an `Options` struct as input.

### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/options.go
This Go file defines an `Options` struct with two fields: `Port` of type `int` and `JsonLog` of type `bool`. The file is auto-generated but can be modified.

### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/demoserver.go
This Go file is an auto-generated server implementation for a gRPC service. It initializes a server with logging capabilities and sets up a gRPC server to listen on a specified port. The server uses an interceptor for logging and registers a BasicServiceServer.

### /basicservice/server/internal/demoserver/demoserver_suite_test.go
This Go test file sets up a test suite for the 'demoserver' package using the Ginkgo testing framework. It defines a single test function, TestDemoserver, which registers a fail handler and runs the test specifications for the Demoserver Suite.
