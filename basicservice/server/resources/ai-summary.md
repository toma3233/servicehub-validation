## File Details
    
### /basicservice/server/resources/template-ServiceResources.Parameters.json
This JSON document is a template for Azure deployment parameters, containing placeholders for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. It is used to parameterize Azure resource deployments.

### /basicservice/server/resources/Makefile
This Makefile is used to manage the build and cleanup processes for alert rules in the project. It includes a target to execute a script for deploying Azure resources related to alert rules and a cleanup target to delete specific files if a certain template file exists. The Makefile is designed to run targets in parallel using the -j2 flag.

### /basicservice/server/resources/deployAzureResources.sh
This Bash script deploys Azure resources using Bicep templates. It takes two arguments: the directory containing Bicep template files and a flag indicating whether to save the outputs. The script deploys each Bicep template found in the specified directory, checks the provisioning state, and optionally saves the outputs if successful.
