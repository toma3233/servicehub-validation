## File Details
    
### /basicservice/api/v1/proto/buf.lock
This document is a buf.lock file generated by the Buf tool, which specifies the dependencies for a protocol buffer setup. It includes version information and a list of dependencies with details such as remote location, owner, repository, commit hash, and digest. The file is not meant to be edited manually as it is automatically generated by Buf.

### /basicservice/api/v1/proto/buf.yaml
The file 'buf.yaml' is a configuration file for the Buf build system, specifying the version, breaking changes policy, lint rules, and dependencies for a protobuf project. It uses version v1, applies default lint rules, and has dependencies on several Buf build packages including protovalidate, loggable, googleapis, and grpc-gateway.

### /basicservice/api/v1/proto/api.proto
This is a Protocol Buffers file defining a gRPC service named `BasicService` which includes a method `SayHello`. The `SayHello` method takes a `HelloRequest` message as input and returns a `HelloReply` message. The `HelloRequest` message includes fields for name, age, email, and an optional address, each with specific validation rules. The `HelloReply` message contains a single string field for the message. The file also includes several imports for annotations and validation, and it provides options for HTTP and OpenAPI v2 integration.
