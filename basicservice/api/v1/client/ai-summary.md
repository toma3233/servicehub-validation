## File Details
    
### /basicservice/api/v1/client/client.go
This Go file defines a client package for creating a gRPC client to connect to a remote service. It includes a function, NewClient, which takes a remote address and interceptor options as inputs, and returns a BasicServiceClient and an error. The function establishes a connection with the specified remote address using insecure transport credentials and registers default client interceptors.

### /basicservice/api/v1/client/client_suite_test.go
This Go test file sets up a test suite for the client package using the Ginkgo testing framework. It registers a fail handler and runs the test specifications defined for the 'Client Suite'.

### /basicservice/api/v1/client/client_test.go
This is a Go test file for the 'client' package, which uses the Ginkgo testing framework. It contains tests for the NewClient function, ensuring it can create a client with a valid address and returns an error with an invalid address.
