## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/demoserver/main.go
This Go file is the main entry point for a command-line application called "MyGreeter". It is auto-generated and should not be modified. The application uses the Cobra library to define a root command that facilitates client-server communication using gRPC and interacts with the Azure SDK. The main function executes the root command.

### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/demoserver/demoserver_suite_test.go
This Go test file uses the Ginkgo and Gomega testing frameworks to set up a test suite for the 'demoserver'. It defines a single test function, TestDemoserver, which registers a failure handler and runs the test specifications for the 'Demoserver Suite'.

### /mygreeterv3/server/cmd/demoserver/start.go
This Go code file defines a command-line interface (CLI) command for starting a demo server using the Cobra library. It includes a 'start' command that initializes server options like port and log format, and calls the 'demoserver.Serve' function to run the server.
