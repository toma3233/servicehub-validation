### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/.method_template_bicep.txt
This Bicep template file is used to define alert rules for monitoring a service called 'mygreeterv3'. It includes parameters for resource configuration and defines modules for query-per-second alerts, error ratio alerts, and latency alerts. These modules use scheduled query rules to monitor specific metrics from log data, with conditions set for triggering alerts based on thresholds. The file references a shared log analytics workspace resource.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/StartLongRunningOperation.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template file defines alert rules for monitoring a service named 'mygreeterv3-StartLongRunningOperation'. It sets up three alert modules: QPS (queries per second), error ratio, and latency by error code. These alerts are configured to trigger based on specific thresholds and conditions, and they utilize an existing Log Analytics Workspace for monitoring. The template includes parameters for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/CreateStorageAccount.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template is used for defining alert rules for the 'mygreeterv3' service, specifically for the 'CreateStorageAccount' method. It includes modules for query-per-second alerts, error ratio alerts, and latency alerts by error code. Each alert rule is configured with criteria such as metric measure columns, operators, queries, thresholds, and other parameters. The template references a shared Log Analytics Workspace and is scoped to a specified resource group within a subscription.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/ListResourceGroups.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template file is used to configure alert rules for monitoring the 'mygreeterv3' service. It defines parameters for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The file references an existing log analytics workspace and sets up three alert rules: query per second, error ratio, and latency by error code. Each alert rule specifies criteria, threshold, and other parameters for monitoring specific metrics of the service.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/DeleteResourceGroup.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template defines alert rules for monitoring the 'DeleteResourceGroup' method in the 'mygreeterv3' service. It sets up alerts based on query per second, error ratio, and latency metrics using Azure Log Analytics and Scheduled Query Rules. The template references a shared Log Analytics workspace and uses modules for defining each alert rule with specific parameters and criteria.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/ReadResourceGroup.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template is used to define alert rules for the 'mygreeterv3' service in Azure. It includes parameters for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The template references an existing Log Analytics Workspace and defines modules for three types of alerts: query per second (QPS), error ratio, and latency by error code. Each alert module specifies criteria, thresholds, and other parameters for monitoring the 'mygreeterv3' service.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/DeleteStorageAccount.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template file defines alert rules for monitoring a service named 'mygreeterv3' related to the 'DeleteStorageAccount' operation. It specifies three alert rules: query-per-second (QPS), error ratio, and latency by error code. These alert rules use a shared Log Analytics workspace and are set up to trigger alerts based on specified criteria such as query count, error ratio, and latency thresholds. The alerts are configured to evaluate every 5 minutes with a severity level of 4.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/UpdateResourceGroup.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template defines alert rules for monitoring a service called 'mygreeterv3'. It includes parameters for resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The template references an existing Log Analytics workspace and sets up three alert rules: query per second, error ratio, and latency by error code. Each alert rule specifies criteria, thresholds, and other configurations for monitoring the service's performance and errors.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/alert-rules/UpdateStorageAccount.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template is used to define and deploy alert rules for monitoring the 'mygreeterv3' service's performance and error metrics in Azure. It includes modules for query-per-second, error ratio, and latency alerts based on logs from the service.
