## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/template-ServiceResources.Parameters.json
This document is a JSON template for Azure deployment parameters. It includes placeholders for resourcesName, subscriptionId, location, and resourceGroupName, which are intended to be replaced with actual values during deployment.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/Makefile
The Makefile in the specified path is designed to automate the deployment of Azure resources. It includes targets for deploying alert rules and the Azure SDK using a script called 'deployAzureResources.sh'. The Makefile allows parallel execution of tasks and also includes a 'clean' target to delete specific files based on conditions.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/deployAzureResources.sh
This bash script is used to deploy Azure resources using Bicep templates. It takes two arguments: the directory containing Bicep template files and a flag indicating whether to save deployment outputs. The script deploys each Bicep template file found in the specified directory by creating an Azure deployment, checks if the deployment succeeded, and optionally saves the outputs. It runs deployments concurrently and checks the exit status of each deployment process.
