## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/azuresdk/saveOutputs.sh
This is a Bash script named 'saveOutputs.sh' that reads a clientId from a provided JSON file and generates a YAML configuration file with the clientId as an annotation. The script requires two arguments: an input JSON file and an output YAML file. It checks the existence of the input file and writes the YAML configuration to the specified output file.

### /mygreeterv3/server/resources/azuresdk/Azuresdk.ServiceResources.Template.bicep
This Bicep template file is used for deploying Azure resources at the subscription level. It defines parameters for the resource names, subscription ID, location, and resource group name. The file references existing resources such as a resource group and a Service Bus namespace, and includes modules for deploying an AKS managed cluster, a managed identity, and role assignments. The template outputs the client ID of the managed identity.
