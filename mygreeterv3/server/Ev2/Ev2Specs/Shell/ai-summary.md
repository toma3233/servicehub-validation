## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/Ev2/Ev2Specs/Shell/push-image-to-acr.sh
This bash script is designed to push Docker images to an Azure Container Registry (ACR). It checks for necessary environment variables such as DESTINATION_ACR_NAME, TARBALL_IMAGE_FILE_SAS, IMAGE_NAME, TAG_NAME, and DESTINATION_FILE_NAME, and exits if any are unset. The script logs into Azure using a managed identity, downloads a Docker tarball image, retrieves ACR credentials, and pushes the image to the specified ACR.
