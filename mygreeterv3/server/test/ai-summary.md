## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/test/testSuites.sh
This Bash script automates the creation of test suites for directories containing Go files in the repository. It uses Ginkgo, a Go testing framework, to generate test suites for folders that have Go files but lack corresponding test suites. The script checks each directory, excluding those with 'mock' in their names, and generates test suites if none exist, ensuring all Go files have associated tests.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/testServiceImage.sh
This is a Bash script for testing and building a Go server module. It navigates to the server directory, sets up Git configuration for a specific remote repository using a read-only personal access token, and then runs Go build and test commands. If the build or test fails, it outputs an error message in red and exits with a non-zero status. If successful, it outputs a success message in green.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/testCoverageOutput.sh
The script `testCoverageOutput.sh` is a bash script designed to automate the process of running Go test coverage for the `mygreeterv3` project. It sets up the environment by configuring Git and installing necessary Go tools, then runs tests using the Ginkgo testing framework, generating a coverage report in HTML format. It checks if the test coverage meets a specified threshold and prints the results in color-coded messages. If the coverage is below the threshold, the script exits with an error.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/provisionServiceResources.sh
This is a Bash script for provisioning service-specific resources in a directory structure related to a server component of a project. The script navigates to the 'mygreeterv3/server' directory and executes a make command to deploy resources. It checks the success of this operation and provides colored output messages indicating success or failure.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/checkServicePodLogs.sh
This is a Bash script that checks the logs of Kubernetes pods within specified namespaces for specific strings, indicating successful operations. It repeatedly checks the logs until either the desired strings are found or a timeout is reached. If the strings are found, it confirms the presence of the desired logs; otherwise, it reports an error if the timeout is reached without finding them.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/buildImage.sh
This is a Bash script used to build a Docker image for a service located in the 'mygreeterv3/server' directory. It checks an environment variable 'WORKSPACE' to determine which make command to use for building the image. If the build fails, it outputs an error message and exits with a non-zero status. If successful, it outputs a success message.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/deployService.sh
This is a bash script for deploying a service in the 'mygreeterv3' directory. It navigates to the server directory, runs a make install command, and checks for successful deployment. It then verifies the service's pod status and logs using additional scripts. If any step fails, it outputs an error message and exits.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/checkServicePodStatus.sh
This is a Bash script that checks the status of pods in specified Kubernetes namespaces. It defines three namespaces and waits for pods in each namespace to become active and ready. It exits with an error message if any namespace does not exist, if no pods are found, or if pods are not running or ready within a specified timeout period.

### /mygreeterv3/server/test/pushImage.sh
This is a Bash script designed to push a Docker image to a repository. It navigates to the 'mygreeterv3/server' directory and executes a 'make push-image' command. If the command fails, it outputs an error message in red and exits with a non-zero status. If successful, it prints a success message in green.
