## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/SayHello.go
This Go file defines a method `SayHello` for a server in the `demoserver` package. It handles a request by logging information and returning a greeting message. The method takes a context and a `HelloRequest` object as inputs and returns a `HelloReply` object and an error. If the request name is "TestPanic", it triggers a panic for testing purposes.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/api.go
The file defines a Go package named `demoserver` which includes a `Server` struct embedding `pb.UnimplementedMyGreeterServer` from a protocol buffer. The struct is designed to override or implement methods from the protocol buffer as needed. The file also includes a constructor function `NewServer` that returns a pointer to a new `Server` instance, and an `init` method that takes an `Options` parameter.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/options.go
The file 'options.go' defines an 'Options' struct with two fields: 'Port' of type int, and 'JsonLog' of type bool. This file is marked as auto-generated but can be modified.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/demoserver.go
The file `demoserver.go` is an auto-generated Go server code for setting up a gRPC server. It initializes a logger, sets up gRPC server options, and listens on a specified port for incoming connections. The server registers the `MyGreeterServer` service and handles requests using the gRPC framework.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/demoserver/demoserver_suite_test.go
This Go test file uses the Ginkgo and Gomega libraries to set up a test suite for the 'demoserver' package. It registers a failure handler and runs the test specifications for the 'Demoserver Suite'.
