The function takes a context and an empty protobuf message as input, and returns a protobuf response containing a list of resource groups or an error.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/ReadStorageAccount.go
This Go file defines a method `ReadStorageAccount` for a server that reads properties of a storage account using Azure's SDK. It takes a `context.Context` and a `ReadStorageAccountRequest` as inputs, and returns a `ReadStorageAccountResponse` or an error. The function logs errors and information using a context logger.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/ListStorageAccounts.go
This Go code defines a method `ListStorageAccounts` for a server that lists Azure storage accounts within a specified resource group. The function takes a context and a request containing the resource group name as inputs, and returns a response containing a list of storage accounts or an error. It uses the Azure SDK for Go to interact with Azure storage services.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/api.go
The Go file defines a `Server` struct for a gRPC server that interacts with Azure services, including resource groups and storage accounts. It includes methods for initializing the server with options, setting up logging, and connecting to Azure services using credentials. The server also supports integration with Azure Service Bus for messaging. The `NewServer` function creates a new server instance, and the `init` method configures it based on provided options, including enabling Azure SDK calls and setting up clients for Azure resources and Service Bus.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/DeleteResourceGroup.go
This Go file defines a method `DeleteResourceGroup` for a server, which handles the deletion of a resource group using a gRPC request. It checks if the `ResourceGroupClient` is available, initiates the deletion process, and polls until the deletion is complete. The method logs actions and errors, and returns an empty protobuf message or an error status.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/server.go
This Go file is an auto-generated server implementation for a gRPC service. It includes functions to start and manage a gRPC server, set up a gRPC-Gateway for HTTP/1.1 clients, and check server status. The main function, Serve, initializes and runs the gRPC server and gateway. Other functions include GetFreePort to find an unused port, StartServer to configure and run the server with specified options, and IsServerRunning to check if the server is active. The file is marked as auto-generated and should not be manually modified.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/CreateResourceGroup.go
This Go file defines a method `CreateResourceGroup` for the `Server` struct, which creates or updates a resource group in Azure using the Azure SDK. It takes a context and a request with the resource group name and region as inputs, and returns an empty response or an error. It logs the actions and errors using a contextual logger.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/DeleteStorageAccount.go
The Go file `DeleteStorageAccount.go` contains a server-side function `DeleteStorageAccount` which deletes a storage account using an Azure SDK client. It takes a context and a request containing resource group and storage account names as input, and returns an empty protobuf message and an error. The function logs errors and success messages using a logger from the context.

### /mygreeterv3/server/internal/server/CreateStorageAccount.go
This Go file is part of a server package and contains functionality for creating Azure storage accounts. It includes functions to generate a unique storage account name and create a storage account using the Azure SDK. The `generateID` function generates a random ID for the storage account name.
