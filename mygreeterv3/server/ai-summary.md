## Directory Summary
This directory contains Dockerfiles and a Makefile for building, packaging, and deploying a Go-based server application. The Dockerfiles utilize a multi-stage build process to compile Go components and package them in a Java runtime, while the Makefile includes tasks for building, testing, and deploying the application within Docker containers and managing Kubernetes operations.

**Tags:** Dockerfile, Go, server, build, deploy, Kubernetes

## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/server/Dockerfile_workspace
This Dockerfile is used to build and deploy a Go-based server application. It uses a multi-stage build process, starting with a Go build environment to compile the server components and then packaging them in a Java-based runtime environment. The build process involves copying source files, setting up Git configurations, and building several server components from a private Azure repository. The final stage copies the built server binaries into an OpenJDK-based image and sets the default command to run the server.

### /mygreeterv3/server/Dockerfile
This Dockerfile is used to build and package a Go-based server application. It consists of two stages: the first stage builds the Go application using a Go image, and the second stage packages the built binaries using an OpenJDK image. The Dockerfile includes commands to configure Git, tidy up Go modules, and build three components: client, demoserver, and server. The final image contains these components and executes the server component.

### /mygreeterv3/server/Makefile
This Makefile is used for building, testing, and deploying a Go application within a Docker container. It includes tasks for templating files, deploying resources, running tests, building binaries, and managing Docker images. Additionally, it supports Kubernetes Helm operations for installing, upgrading, and uninstalling services.
