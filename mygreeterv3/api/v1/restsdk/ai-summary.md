### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/restsdk/.swagger-codegen-ignore
This file, .swagger-codegen-ignore, is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by the Swagger Codegen tool. It lists .travis.yml and all files within the docs directory to be ignored.

### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/restsdk/model_update_storage_account_response.go
This file defines a Go struct named `UpdateStorageAccountResponse` within the `restsdk` package. It represents a response model that includes a pointer to a `StorageAccount` struct, which can be serialized to JSON with an optional field `storageAccount`. The file is generated by Swagger Codegen.

### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/restsdk/model_start_long_running_operation_response.go
This file, generated by Swagger Codegen, defines a Go struct named StartLongRunningOperationResponse within the 'restsdk' package. The struct contains a single field, OperationId, which is a string that can be serialized to JSON with the key 'operationId'.

### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/restsdk/response.go
This Go file, generated by Swagger Codegen, defines an APIResponse struct used in the 'restsdk' package. The struct includes fields for HTTP responses, messages, operation names, request URLs, HTTP methods, and payloads. It provides two functions: NewAPIResponse, which creates a new APIResponse with an HTTP response, and NewAPIResponseWithError, which creates a new APIResponse with an error message.

### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/restsdk/model_create_storage_account_response.go
This Go file contains a data model for a response from a storage account creation API, generated by Swagger Codegen. It defines a struct named CreateStorageAccountResponse with a single field 'Name' of type string, which is optional in JSON serialization.

### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/restsdk/git_push.sh
This shell script is used to automate the process of initializing a Git repository, committing changes, and pushing them to a remote GitHub repository.
