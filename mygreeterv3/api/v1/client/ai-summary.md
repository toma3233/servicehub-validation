## File Details
    
### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/client/client.go
The Go file `client.go` defines a package `client` that provides a function `NewClient`. This function establishes a gRPC connection to a specified remote address with a set of interceptors, returning a `MyGreeterClient` and any connection error encountered. It utilizes insecure transport credentials and logs connection errors.

### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/client/client_suite_test.go
This Go test file sets up a testing suite for the client package using Ginkgo and Gomega. It registers a fail handler and runs the test specifications for the 'Client Suite'.

### /mygreeterv3/api/v1/client/client_test.go
This Go test file uses the Ginkgo and Gomega libraries to test the client creation functionality. It includes two tests: one to verify that a new client is created successfully with a valid address and another to ensure that an error is returned when an invalid address is provided.
