# In order to do the onecert registration, you need to be on your SAW.
# 1. Navigate to aka.ms/onecert. This will take you to the OneCert portal. Select "Domain Registrations" from the top menu. This should show a dropdown. Select "Register New Domain" from the dropdown.
# 2. Fill in the form with the following values below.
# 3. [After inputting values] If creating, select "Create Domain Registration". If you are updating, select "Update Domain Registration". It takes about a minute or less to create/udpate.
# We HIGHLY recommend you do not change any of values in this file, except for Subscription IDs and Owners. The values in this file are used elsewhere and changing them will cause issues. If you want to change this, please contact the Service Hub team.
# We provide the details of domain registration for each tenant within a cloud.
# - PublicAME (prod): This is the domain registration for the AME tenant in the Public cloud. This is used for production resources.
# - PublicMSFT (test): This is the domain registration for the MSFT tenant in the Public cloud. This is used for test resources.
# We currently do not have the domain registration values for the other clouds and tenants. We will add them when we have them.

Geneva_PublicAME (prod):
  Domain: prod.ame.servicehubval.azure.net # DO NOT CHANGE. This is immutable and cannot be changed after the domain is registered. Any certificate issued must match a registered domain. This follows certain naming conventions established by the OneCert team. For every cloud, there are certain domain suffixes you must adhere to. We have selected an established naming suffix for the domain name that works in the Azure Public Cloud, "azure.net". Do not change this value. Not adhering to this naming convention will also cause issues with account creation, given that Geneva may likewise validate the domain name.
  Cloud: Public # DO NOT CHANGE. This cannot be changed after the domain is registered.
  Tenants: AME # DO NOT CHANGE. This is also immutable and cannot be changed after the domain is registered. You can only select 1. Note that the OneCert cli, if used, may allow you to select multiple tenants. This is a bug in the OneCert cli and will cause a security flag. Due to new SFI policies, you can only select 1 tenant.
