## File Details
    
### /terraform-files/terraform.tfstate
This document is a Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) that contains the current state of infrastructure managed by Terraform. It includes information about resources such as Azure AD applications, Azure Key Vaults, Azure DevOps projects, and pipelines. It also includes outputs like project names and repository URLs, with some values redacted for security reasons. The file lists various dependencies and configurations for resources, including Azure subscriptions, service principals, and role assignments.

### /terraform-files/variables.tf
This Terraform variables file defines several variables related to an Azure DevOps setup, including organization URL, project name, repository name, and various Azure resource identifiers like application name, service tree ID, and subscription ID. It also includes configurations for a service connection and a key vault for storing personal access tokens (PATs).

### /terraform-files/main.tf
This Terraform configuration file is used to set up Azure DevOps resources including a project, a Git repository, variable groups, build pipelines, and service connections. It defines providers for Azure DevOps, Azure Resource Manager (azurerm), and Azure Active Directory (azuread). The configuration creates a private project with Git version control, initializes a repository, sets up a variable group to store personal access tokens (PATs), and defines two build pipelines (test and development). Additionally, it configures service principals and role assignments for permissions and creates a service connection endpoint for pipeline authentication using workload identity federation.

### /terraform-files/.terraform.lock.hcl
This file is a Terraform lock file, automatically generated by the "terraform init" command, which locks the versions and hashes of the Terraform providers used in the configuration. It includes the providers for Azure Active Directory, Azure Resource Manager, and Azure DevOps with specific versions and their corresponding hashes for integrity verification.

### /terraform-files/outputs.tf
This Terraform configuration file defines several output variables related to an Azure DevOps setup, including repository URL, project name, repository name, service connection name, and personal access tokens (PATs). The PATs are marked as sensitive.
