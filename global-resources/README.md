# Provision Global Resources

Please refer to the [GenevaLogsAutomationExplained.md](../readme_templates/GenevaLogsAutomationExplained.md) in the README directory for further information on the set up and workflow of the global resources.

## What are global resources?

Global resources are resources that we only need to create *once* for a ring.
- Key Vault and certificate


In the future, we want to potentially maintain a set of these resources for each ring, which unfortunately we currently do not have set up. We are looking further into the specifics of the Geneva to Kusto setup for different rings. We currently only have a set up for the different environments, test and production.
